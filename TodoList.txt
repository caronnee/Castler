- show wireframe or points only, button check
- implement calibration
- Detect points from images, different ways. Find the most corresponding
- motion estimator
- implement memory controlling
- C:\work\DP1\opencv_src\samples\cpp\stitching_detailed.cpp
- using autofocus?
- KD TREE exists in cv
- what is MSER?
- shape comparison
-image segmentation
- detect degradation from camera movement
- Why is drawchessboard separate function? - draws lines1		
- manually pick up point that might be similar. automated help
- offect canny to set correspondece. Possible other detections
- use hughes transformation to calibrate
- find if in the video there is movement degradation
- find chessboard in the videos tried with my camera / drone
- create file from bruteforce, ordinary one
- show white color based on normal
- make light, movable light, light == camera, only cone changing
- filter for errors
- implement comparator
- detect moving people, to obscure the behind
- Panoramas matching? Is it useful?
- interchangable lens - vplyv na paramatre, ako poznat, ze sa mi zmenil focus?
- najst kameru so zmenenym focusom vo videu
- runcalibration sa zmeit na stop, aby bool jasne, ze sa kliklo
- reconstructon from one photo / painting
- make wireframe working

// use standard calibration code [Tsai87]
– use view correlation [Bogart91]
– use through the lens camera control [Gleicher92]
