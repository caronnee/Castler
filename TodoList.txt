- implement current model/light properties
- implementant flood vertices for showing - better performance
- manually pick up point that might be similar. automated help
- offect canny to set correspondece. Possible other detections
- detect degradation from camera movement
- use hughes transformation to calibrate
- find if in the video there is movement degradation
- find chessboard in the videos tried with my camera / drone
- create file from bruteforce, ordinary one
- show white color based on normal
- make light, movable light, light == camera, only cone changing
- filter for errors
- implement comparator
- detect moving people, to obscure the behind
- Panoramas matching? Is it useful?
- interchangable lens - vplyv na paramatre, ako poznat, ze sa mi zmenil focus?
- najst kameru so zmenenym focusom vo videu
- runcalibration sa zmeit na stop, aby bool jasne, ze sa kliklo
- reconstructon from one photo / painting

// use standard calibration code [Tsai87]
– use view correlation [Bogart91]
– use through the lens camera control [Gleicher92]
